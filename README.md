In sensors dir i store python filesa. They have source code of microcontrollers controlling sensors. In firs step we have to check if every sensor work corect, then we can put every thing together and star thinking how to connectrs all sensors to one microcontrorel. Afther this we have to creat a program who will read data form sensor store in data base and make appropriate decisions based on the data received.

2. Soil_moistur_sensor.py

So far i can read value from the sensor. Value 3 means that senso is free (sensor is not touching enything). When i put sensor to water value is something about 645 650.
When i put sensor to the ground, right now it shows 450. The ground looks like is wet enough.
